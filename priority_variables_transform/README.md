# Transforming variables with LinkML-Map

This directory began with a bunch of yaml files that needed reformatting.
I don't know what a detailed algorithm for this reformatting would be,
but the easiest-to-spot difference is that the original files start with
`priority_variable:` and the converted files start with `class_derivations:`

- @diatomsRcool moved the copdgene-related yaml files into
  [copdgene](copdgene).
- @amc-corey-cox used ChatGPT to convert most of these into the target
  format and the results are in [copdgene-linkml-map](copdgene-linkml-map).
- The rest of the yaml files (in this directory) are for FHS. Some of them
  had already been converted. @sigfried moved those (the yaml files in
  this directory starting with `class_derivations:`) into [FHS](FHS).
- @sigfried copied the remaining, unconverted files into
  [input_directory](./batch_converting/input_directory), and used
  [linkml_transform_script.py](batch_converting/linkml_transform_script.py)
  (a python script generated by claude.ai) to convert input files into the
  [output_directory](batch_converting/output_directory).
- Claude.ai explains its conversion script
  [here](batch_converting/complete_transformation.md)
